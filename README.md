A quick tip for "Closed Source":
If you are uploading this to GitHub so you can host it, make sure you set the repository to Private.
 * Public Repository: Anyone can see your code (Open Source style).
 * Private Repository: Only you can see the code, but you can still host it on Netlify or Vercel so your friend can use the finished website.
